#Store Front 


*As a store owner, I want to create a new entry for a product with a name, price, and description.

*As a shopper, I want to see a list of all the products in the store, and be able to click on them to get more information.

*As a store owner, I want to make sure only I and other store employees can add, edit, and remove products. 

*As a store owner, I want to add product in bulk by uploading a CSV with information on them.

*As a store owner, I want to optionally add an image to a product.

*As a store owner, after I upload a CSV, I want to see a list of any rows that couldn't be imported.
